Implementation of the Content Claims Protocol.

Read the [spec](https://hackmd.io/@gozala/content-claims).


## Getting Started

The repo contains the infra deployment code and the service implementation.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ packages   - content-claims core and lambda wrapper
â””â”€â”€ stacks     - sst and AWS CDK code to deploy all the things
```

To work on this codebase **you need**:

- Node.js >= v18 (prod env is node v18)
- An AWS account with the AWS CLI configured locally
- Copy `.env.tpl` to `.env` and fill in the blanks
- Install the deps with `npm i`

Deploy dev services to your AWS account and start dev console. You may need to provide a `--profile` to pick the aws profile to deploy with.

```sh
npm start
```

See: https://docs.sst.dev for more info on how things get deployed.


## Environment variables

The following should be set in the env when deploying. Copy `.env.tpl` to `.env` to set in dev.

```sh
SENTRY_DSN=<your error reporting key here>

# Region of the DynamoDB to query
DYNAMO_REGION=us-west-2

# Private key for the service
PRIVATE_KEY=MgCblCY...
```

#### `SENTRY_DSN`

Data source name for Sentry application monitoring service.

#### `DYNAMO_REGION`

Region of the DynamoDB to query.

#### `PRIVATE_KEY`

The [`multibase`](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase) encoded ED25519 keypair used as the signing key for content-claims.

Generated by [@ucanto/principal `EdSigner`](https://github.com/web3-storage/ucanto) via [`ucan-key`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ucan-key)

_Example:_ `MgCZG7EvaA...1pX9as=`


### Secrets

Set production secrets in AWS SSM via [`sst secrets`](https://docs.sst.dev/config#sst-secrets). The region must be set to the one you deploy that stage to:

```sh
# set `PRIVATE_KEY` for prod
$ npx sst secrets set --region us-west-2 --stage prod PRIVATE_KEY "MgCblCY...="
```

To set a fallback value for `staging` or an ephemeral PR build use [`sst secrets set --fallback`](https://docs.sst.dev/config#fallback-values)

```sh
# set `PRIVATE_KEY` for any stage in us-east-2
$ npx sst secrets set --region us-east-2 --fallback PRIVATE_KEY "MgCZG7...="
```

**note** The fallback value can only be inherited by stages deployed in the same AWS account and region.

Confirm the secret value using [`sst secrets list`](https://docs.sst.dev/config#sst-secrets)

```sh
$ npx sst secrets list --region us-east-2
PRIVATE_KEY MgCZG7...= (fallback)

$ npx sst secrets list --region us-west-2 --stage prod
PRIVATE_KEY M...=
```


## Supported claims

These are the types of claim that we're interested in from the spec:

### Location claim

Capability: `assert/location`

Input:

```js
{
  content: CID /* CAR CID */, 
  location: ['https://r2.cf/bag...car', 's3://bucket/bag...car'],
  range?: { offset: number, length?: number } /* Optional: Byte Range in URL */
}
```

### Inclusion claim

Claims that within a CAR, there are a bunch of CIDs (and their offsets).

Capability: `assert/inclusion`

Input:

```js
{
  content: CID /* CAR CID */,
  includes: CID /* CARv2 Index CID */,
  proof?: CID /* Optional: zero-knowledge proof */
}
```

### Partition claim

Claims that a DAG can be found in a bunch of CAR files.

Capability: `assert/partition`

Input:

```js
{
  content: CID /* Content Root CID */,
  blocks?: CID, /* CIDs CID */
  parts: [
    CID /* CAR CID */,
    CID /* CAR CID */,
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Relation claim ðŸ†•

Claims that a block of content links to other blocks. Similar to a partition claim, a relation claim asserts that a block of content links to other blocks and, that the block and it's links may be found in the specified parts.

Capability: `assert/relation`

Input:

```js
{
  content: CID /* Block CID */,
  children: [
    CID /* Linked block CID */,
    CID /* Linked block CID */,
    ...
  ],
  parts: [
    CID, /* CAR CID */
    CID, /* CAR CID */
    ...
  ]
}
```


## DynamoDB tables

```ts
interface ClaimTable {
  /** Claim type: "location"|"inclusion"|"partition"|"relation" */
  type: string

  /** CID of the UCAN invocation task we received this claim in. */
  claim: string // Note: sort key

  /** Content of the claim */
  bytes: Uint8Array

  /** The subject of the claim. */
  content: string // Note: partition key

  /** UCAN expiration */
  expiration: number
}
```
